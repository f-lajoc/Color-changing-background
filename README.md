## My process

### Built with

- Css Animaion
- Bootstrap
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### Thoughts & Troubles


- If there is a possible way to put the changing color in light bulb like making it contained within the bulb only and not the background

- i wanted to make the start button also the stop button instead of using two different buttons but i couldn't find my way around it, it's probably due to the loop timeout set in my Js file


### What I learned and used

- I used getElementByTagName, and for this, the index have to be specified, I'll need to practice using it to build memory muscle of it

- first time using setTimeout function, i haven't fully grasped it yet

- first time using CSS animation ~ keyframes which i need to learn more about

-I used bootstrap css for my Button

From the knowledge I have now, i used some JavaScript I've learnt like

- variable declaration
- function
- array
- conditional statement
- fetching DOM
- JavaScript style

### Continued development

I should learn some CSS part I'm yet to master side by side with JavaScript 
- Flex
- Grid
- Transition
- Animation
- Responsiveness 
- bootstrap
